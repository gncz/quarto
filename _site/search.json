It is a function of money it should be able to serve, by definition. Decisions over spending and/or saving is essentially the individual’s past, the present and future compressed into simple numbers.\nHowever, the people of the world today must navigate in a floating currency environment, where the value of the each currency changes, not only due to the real market conditions, but also according to the present money supply.\nThe root of the problem is, that our past decisions are irreversible, while the present value of past decisions fluctuate, according to the current money supply.\nThis page is lamentation for this conundrum."

    "text": "Bringing it down to the ground\nFiat money is nominal. The experienced world seems less so. Therefore in order anchor it down to something real, we need a common ground. To explore what might have happened to the consumers I will take a look at Big Mac Index. It is a well-established tool, originally published by the Economist, with rich academic background.\n\nThe Big Mac index\n\n\nCode\n#the source\nurl_bm_index=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data/refs/heads/master/source-data/big-mac-source-data-v2.csv\"\n\n#the two countries\nreq_cntries = ['HUN', 'USA']\n\n#filtering\ndf_bm_souce=pd.read_csv(url_bm_index)\ndf_bm=df_bm_souce[df_bm_souce['iso_a3'].isin(req_cntries)]\n\n\nThe first chart demonstrates the local price of the Big Mac in these countries. The brilliance of this is, that the essential value proposition of the product is effectively the same. By that I mean calories, nutrition and taste. This traverses time and space, which my simple diagrams also intend to achieve. Everything that is dependent on technology gets outdated and or depreciated over time. Other products might have huge cultural and local variations. Big Mac is free of these burdens.\nWriting these lines, it occured me that subscriptions prices in different countries could serve the same, or even better proxy for the purchasing power proxy. Given if enough data are gathered in the future.\n\n\nCode\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nimport pandas as p\n\nfig = make_subplots(specs=[[{\"secondary_y\":True}]])\n\nfig.add_trace(\n    go.Scatter(\n        x=df_bm[df_bm['iso_a3']=='HUN']['date'],\n        y=df_bm[df_bm['iso_a3']=='HUN'][\"local_price\"],\n        name=\"Price in Hungarian Forints\",\n        mode='lines+markers',\n        line=dict(color='goldenrod')\n    ),\n    secondary_y=False,\n)\nfig.add_trace(\n    go.Scatter(\n        x=df_bm[df_bm['iso_a3']=='USA'][\"date\"],\n        y=df_bm[df_bm['iso_a3']=='USA'][\"local_price\"],\n        name=\"Price in USA Dollars\",\n        mode='lines+markers',\n        line=dict(color='blue')\n    ),\n    secondary_y=True,\n)\nfig.update_layout(\n    title_text=\"Big Mac in local prices\",\n    hovermode='x unified',\n    legend=dict(yanchor=\"top\", y=0.9, xanchor='left',x=0.01)\n\n)\nfig.update_yaxes(\n    title_text=\"Price in Hungarian Forint\",\n    secondary_y=False,\n    color='goldenrod'\n\n)\nfig.update_yaxes(\n    title_text=\"Price in USA Dollars\",\n    secondary_y=True,\n    color='blue'\n)\nfig.update_yaxes(\n    title_text=\"Price in Hungarian Forint\",\n    secondary_y=False,\n    color='goldenrod'\n\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure shows that there was a general uptrend in prices, although in Hungary there was a 5 year period of tranquility where the prices stayed flat.\n\nEven in this post financial crises period, the Hungarian money supply expanded substantially from 17T to 23T. Nonetheless the price of the Big Mac flatlined this. This might point to the fact, that there were real growth present in the Hungarian economy during this period, which could accomodate the extra money supply without causing inflation.\nSecondary, the impact of the rapid price increase starting 2020 is paramount. Meaning that any theoretical person who was saving Forints before 2020 to buy Big Macs after 2020 had to face the grim fact, that their calculations were fundamentally altered during the currency expansion. This leads us back the first point. Our theoretical persons past decisions had been overwritten for the worst. Losing past time and utility forever. Leading the argument in another way, the units of Forints did not traverse space and time intact."

Even though the Forint’s value decreased to dollars. Puting it another way, the depreciation of Forint to Dollars did not effect the price of Big Macs for the consumers on the local market.\n\nThe chart on the rights points out that the Big Macs are could be considered undervalued. If the sellers of the Big Macs product on the Hungarian market were to account entirely in dollars, should they raise prices to balance this. Luckily, this is has not been the case."
